## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/daa-algorithms.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the desired algorithm directory:

    ```bash
    cd daa-algorithms/algorithms/graph
    ```

3. Run the algorithm:

    ```bash
    python bfs.py
    ```

Replace `bfs.py` with the algorithm you wish to run.
